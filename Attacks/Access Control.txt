Get the url http://localhost:5000/chickenyoualmostthereaccounts

This url shows you all the accounts in the website, and only admins have the button that gets you there, but you can get there too..

You need to build a script that tries common urls and prints the urls that returns success.
Or, maybe, you could just use the script we already gave you that does it..
